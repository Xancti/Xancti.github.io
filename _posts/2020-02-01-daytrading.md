# Reflections on attempting to Day Trade

Recently, I've considered learning to Day Trade as my primary source of cash flow has for the most part, been crippled.

The first two attempts didn't go too well, with me losing about USD 550 in the first attempt and then USD 100 in the second. While that money certainly could've been better used, it wasn't entirely wasted as it taught me a few things regarding Day Trading.

If I had to sum it up, the critical factor is really to minimize your downside which is achieved via (a) a large sum to day trade with, (b) minimal transaction cost and (c) momentum.

## (a) Equity Size
The larger the day trading amount, the easier it is to cover against transaction costs (which ideally, are fixed).

Scenario A: Transaction cost of $10 USD
Variables: USD $10,000 and USD $20,000

In the case of buying USD $10,000 worth of shares, you'll be charged USD $10 in transaction costs, meaning to say, to break even, your shares need to earn (10/10000)% or [0.1%] profit just to break even.

Of course, if we took the higher of the variable, then shares now have to earn (10/20000)% [.05%] profit.

## (b) Minimal Transaction Cost

Fundamental to this, is that the rates are fixed and not percentage-based of the total transaction (in which case, you'd always have to cover the same percentage, regardless of equity size).

Bringing down the numerator (i.e. the transaction cost) also helps reduce the required breakeven amount.

(a) and (b) are both significant as they allow you to enter and exit trades far more quickly - thereby reducing exposure/risk - and have a greater volume of trades.

## (c) Momentum
I think the right word for this would be market psychology, as my sister has pointed out. Find stocks that are trading on good news or good news to be e.g. the recent $2 trillion stimulus.

Note-to-self: Really ought to finish these blog posts on time, but it's also good that I don't because then I can power through them in a more condensed manner.

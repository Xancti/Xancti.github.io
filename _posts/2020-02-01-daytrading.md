# Reflections on attempting to Day Trade

Recently, I've considered learning to Day Trade as my primary source of cash flow has for the most part, been crippled.

The first two attempts didn't go too well, with me losing about USD 550 in the first attempt and then USD 100 in the second. While that money certainly could've been better used, it wasn't entirely wasted as it taught me a few things regarding Day Trading.

If I had to sum it up, the critical factor is really to minimize your downside which is achieved via (a) a large sum to day trade with, (b) minimal transaction cost and (c) momentum.

## (a) Equity Size
The larger the day trading amount, the easier it is to cover against transaction costs (which ideally, are fixed).

Scenario A: Transaction cost of $20 USD* minimum or 0.3% (whichever is higher)
Variables: USD $10,000 and USD $20,000

In the case of buying USD $10,000 worth of shares, you'll be charged USD $30 in transaction costs, meaning to say, to break even, your shares

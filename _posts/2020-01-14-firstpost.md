# First Post

Can't count the number of times I've created a new blog, and it's typically hopeful -- cheering on some writing journey that's never taken.

So in learning from experience, I'm going to skip all the fanfare.

It's been about 8 years since I've blogged consistently. Back then it was a nice place to vent while figuring my way through adolescence. Now, it's because I need somewhere to reflect on the ongoings of my life and also plan through the use of a To-Do List.

Here's one:

Activity To-Do | Notes
-------------- | -----
Buy BitCoin **[Incomplete]** | Rationale: Possibility of BitCoin increasing by 100% due to halvening; not something that I can foresee with most stocks. Certainly possible for Marijuana shares, but somewhat tenuous. Even with NVDA, we're reasonably looking at a 20% increase from the current of 250.
Create BinanceSG Account **[Incomplete]** | Necessary for purchase of BTC; will most likely need to link Xfers
Shift funds out of Trading Account **[Incomplete]** | Figure out how much needs to be moved

## An unrelated note
But in relation to romantic relationships, when things aren't looking too good, I think the general solution is to love harder and commit more.

Based on the few stories I've read, giving up (not that it's crossed my mind!) seems to be the one thing that people regret the most* and they tend to wish that they tried harder to love their former partners. Certainly too little, too late; take what you've learnt and apply it to the next relationship, when you're ready.

{% include info.html text="Minimizing regret seems to be essential to being happy, so I suppose, if happiness is the goal, then this is the logical thing to do." %}

{% include alert.html text="Is happiness the goal though?" %}

Tell me that last line doesn't hit you.

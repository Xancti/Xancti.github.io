# First Post

Can't count the number of times I've created a new blog, and it's typically hopeful -- cheering on some writing journey that's never taken.

So in learning from experiences, I'm going to skip all the fanfare.

It's been about 8 years since I've blogged consistently. Back then it was a nice place to vent while figuring out my adolescence. Whereas now,
it's because I need somewhere to reflect on the ongoings of life and also plan through the use of a To-Do List.

Here's one:

Activity To-Do | Notes
-------------- | -----
- [ ] Buy BitCoin | Rationale: Possibility of Bitcoin increasing by more than 100%, which is not something foreseeable for most stocks      that I currently have my eye on
                    - [ ] Setup BinanceSG Account
                    - [ ] Shift funds into BinanceSG Account
